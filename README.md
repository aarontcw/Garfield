Ideas were brainstormed and measured against a Prioritization Matrix to determine a solution with acceptable technical complexity that brings the highest user value given the tight dateline. **Solutioning SafeEntry** was then chosen as the focus of this project.

A survey was conducted with 30 participants residing in different parts of Singapore to find out their dining experience from 10th August. The result shown that **at least 70%** of the participants have began dining in at Food & Beverage (F&B) establishments.<br />

Among those whom dined at F&Bs, **73% of them** indicated that **waiting time** was a major issue due to **occupancy limit, social distancing regulations, short staffed during peak hours and the need for everyone verify their vaccination status**.<br />

When prompted further, **50% of them** found that **the need to check vaccination status** has affected their dining experience elaborating that these checks incurred longer unneccessary waiting time with some of the following issues:
<li>Refreshing for vaccination status takes time</li>
<li>Network coverage issues when dining in underground F&Bs, having to wait longer for TraceTogether app to complete its refresh (TPG Telco Users)</li>
<li>When not using TraceTogether app, Venue Operator SafeEntry App needs to scan every individual and wait for response on vaccination status</li>

# Storyboard & User Journey Map

A User Journey Map was created, along with a Storyboard, to study and empathize the process of how diners in Singapore experience during their dine in journey.

# Problem Statement
### _"How might we improve the waiting time to check vaccination status of individuals so that the experience of diners in F&B will not be affected?"_

# Proposed Solution
Given the problem statement, a good consideration would be "upgrading" the existing SafeEntry Gateway.
This could be solutioned as the following:
<li>Different light indicator to quickly identify the diner's vaccination status âœ…</li>
<li>Modify the frequency of "beep" to determine the diner's vaccination status</li>
<li>Tune the "beep" into unique jingles/tones/music to differentiate the diner's vaccination status</li>
